Syria: searching for ways to end the violence
The Syrian regime is increasingly isolated on the world stage. Interviewed on 7 January, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle called for Assad to resign and make way for a democratic fresh start in Syria.
On 11 November, the Syrian opposition agreed to set up a new joint body,
The deadlock in the United Nations Security Council continues.
Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has repeatedly called upon China and Russia, both veto powers, to stop backing the Syrian regime.
The Security Council has been struggling for months to agree on a united stance in relation to the Syrian regime.

The conflict in Syria was also a dominant theme during the opening week of the United Nations General Assembly from 25 September to 1 October.
Lakhdar Brahimi, the new Joint Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Arab League, reported on developments to the Security Council.
Brahimi took over from Kofi Annan when the latter chose not to extend his mandate.
The plan has yet to be implemented.
The UN observer mission UNSMIS, which was established to monitor implementation of the Annan plan, also came to an end on 19 August.
Opposition platform gains international recognition

Syria’s opposition plays an important role in the planning for a peaceful future for the country.
At a meeting held in Doha, the capital of Qatar, from 8 to 11 November, the opposition agreed to form a new joint body, a step which Minister Westerwelle welcomed.
This National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces was recognized by the EU on 10 December and by the Group of Friends of the Syrian People on 12 December as “legitimate representatives of the Syrian people”.
As Foreign Minister Westerwelle noted at the Group of Friends meeting in Marrakech on 12 December, this amounted to a strong message from the vast majority of the international community in favour of peaceful change in Syria and a fresh start based on democracy and pluralism.
The meeting in Marrakech was attended by representatives of 114 countries and 14 international organizations.
The participants included National Coalition President Sheikh Ahmed Moaz alKatib,
whom Westerwelle had already met in Cairo on 13 November, on the margins of a conference of EU and Arab League foreign ministers.

Refugee numbers have continued to rise dramatically, according to UN estimates.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs puts the number of conflict victims inside Syria at more than four million.
More than 650,000 people have left Syria for neighbouring countries,
a figure expected to rise considerably as the conflict drags on.
In 2012, the German Government made available around 90 million euros in humanitarian aid.
This money is being spent on projects inside Syria as well as in neighbouring countries.
In a report issued in January 2013, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization stated that around one and half million people in the regions most affected by the conflict would be in urgent need of emergency aid over the coming three to six months.
According to the report, Syria’s agricultural output had been severely reduced, down by as much as 50% in some areas.
The UN’s seven aid agencies sent representatives in January to inspect the situation on the ground.
After visiting the towns of Homs and Talbiseh, they expressed dismay at the conditions they found there.
It has set up an independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria to examine and document human rights violations in the country.
The Commission’s mandate was recently extended until March 2013.
According to a study commissioned by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Navi Pillay, at least 60,000 people were killed in Syria between March 2011 and the end of November 2012.
On 4 December, in response to fresh reports of that nature, Foreign Minister Westerwelle warned the Syrian regime that such action would be “totally unacceptable”.

Human rights defenders are, in my view, everyday heroes.
They make an immeasurable contribution to improving human rights around the world, often at great personal risk.
Supporting and protecting such people is one of the goals of our human rights policy.
The conference also aims to further improve our practical human rights work in the area.
I am thus very pleased to have the opportunity to talk to human rights activists from thirteen different countries."
This is already the fourth conference organized by the Federal Foreign Office for human rights defenders.
Following events for South America, the Middle East, North Africa and West Africa, the focus this time is on Central America and the Caribbean region.
Markus Löning, the Federal Government Human Rights Commissioner, has issued the following statement:
Human rights in Central America and the Caribbean – Federal Foreign Office to organize conference for human rights activists
The Federal Foreign Office, together with its embassies in Central America and the Caribbean, is organizing a regional conference in Panama for human rights activists on 17 and 18 April.
"I am delighted to be able to meet human rights defenders from Central America and the Caribbean at this event.
This is why we have, in the last two years, organized conferences at various locations around the world in conjunction with our embassies and human rights defenders.
Our embassy staff and I myself hope to learn more about the human rights situation in the region by talking to local human rights defenders.
Central America and the Caribbean is an important partner region for Germany, which, however, rarely finds itself in the international spotlight.
We therefore feel it is all the more important to enter into an intensive dialogue with representatives from the region.
Human rights defenders from thirteen countries including Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Cuba and Guyana, will be brought together with embassy staff.
The conference will focus on human rights issues of significance in the region, such as women's rights, the rule of law, impunity, organized crime, freedom of opinion and press freedom, as well as the rights of indigenous peoples and sexual minorities.
Prohibition of anti-personnel mines
The Ottawa Convention is the central treaty on the global prohibition of anti-personnel mines.
Minefield
Its most important provisions are:
a comprehensive prohibition of the production, use, transfer and stockpiling of all types of anti-personnel mines;
an undertaking to destroy existing stocks within four years;
an undertaking to cooperate as far as possible on mine clearance (including technical support), provide information on the dangers posed by mines, and victim assistance;
a credible verification regime.
Implementation
In recent years only three countries have actually deployed anti-personnel mines.
The annually issued Landmine Monitor Report documents the progress made as well as the challenges that remain from a civil society perspective.
Review Conferences and Meetings of States Parties
The Meetings of States Parties are held alternately in a country affected by landmines and in Geneva (1999 Maputo, 2000 Geneva, 2001 Managua, 2002 Geneva, 2003 Bangkok, 2004 Geneva, 2005 Zagreb, 2006 Geneva, 2007 Amman, 2008 Geneva, 2009 Cartagena, 2010 Geneva, 2011 Phnom Penh, 2012 Geneva).
The goal of Germany and its EU partners is to ensure that the Ottawa Convention is applied globally and implemented rigorously.
In the international context the EU (the Commission and the member states combined) is by far the largest donor towards humanitarian mine clearance; between 2006 and 2010 it provided roughly a billion euros.
This figure represents almost half of the total worldwide contribution to humanitarian mine-related projects that year.
The Ottawa Convention (Convention of 18 September 1997 on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction) is the central treaty on the global prohibition of anti-personnel mines.
It has been a milestone in international humanitarian law ever since it entered into force on 1 March 1999.
The Ottawa Convention was signed in that city by 121 countries, including Germany, on 3 and 4 December 1997. To date, a total of 161 countries have ratified or acceded to the Convention.
an undertaking to clear emplaced anti-personnel mines within ten years; this deadline can be extended by a decision taken by the Meeting of the States Parties;
Since the Ottawa Convention entered into force, stockpiles of more than 45 million anti-personnel mines have been destroyed; 88 States Parties, including Germany, have reported that they have completely eliminated their stocks, while 66 States Parties reported never having had any stocks.
During the second Review Conference, held from 30 November to 3 December 2009 in Cartagena (Colombia), progress was assessed and remaining challenges were identified.
An Action Plan (the “Cartagena Plan”) was adopted to tackle the remaining challenges and guarantee that deadlines for the destruction of stockpiles and mine clearance were complied with.
The EU – the world's largest donor towards humanitarian mine clearance
In 2012, the Federal Foreign Office provided 18 million euros for projects in 28 countries and for multilateral programmes.
In 2010 over 180 million euros in funding was provided for projects.
Germany, the largest EU contributor, also accounts for some 20 per cent of contributions to humanitarian mine and ordnance clearance under the auspices of ECHO, the European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid Office.
Diplomacy up close
How to let people abroad get to know Germany?
An Open Day can do the trick, as our man in Warsaw reports.
The Open Day was a cheerful neighbourhood party.
Relations between Germany and Poland are close.
Not only do their Governments work together closely, Polish and German people have also been coming to know one another better over recent decades through such arrangements as youth exchange programmes and town twinnings.
One might wonder what is left for German public relations to do in Poland.
Plenty, says our colleague Konrad Lax. Press Officer at the German Embassy in Warsaw for the last three years,
he looks back at the Open Day held there.
In his comment pieces for an influential national-conservative newspaper, he has been known, for example, to compare Germany's policy on Europe to Kaiser Wilhelm's colonialist pretensions and describe the German political foundations operating in Poland as Government agents.
On this particular Saturday, though, he is primarily thrilled with Germany.
and he is hooked too.
Public relations aimed at everyone

That can even be taken quite literally; a lot of our Open Day visitors live in the immediate neighbourhood.
Easily more than 5000 visitors flood the Embassy premises on Open Day.
Today, there are children in the visa section filling in pretend passports, and hundreds of balloons are sent on their way with postcards attached.
Long queues form at the stands supplying sausages, baking and drinks.
