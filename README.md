# AATT
AATT (Advanced Adaptive Transformer Topologies) is an experimental implementation of transformer network topologies optimization methods, including the use of:
* Surrogate optimization
* Simulated annealing

This is my master thesis code.

My master thesis is written at the Faculty of Physics and  Applied Computer Science, AGH University of Technology in Kraków, supervised by Professor Szymon Łukasik.
